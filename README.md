What is Codey Vs. Coder?


Codey Vs. Coder is an interactive web game that teaches basic debugging to people interested in learning Java/HTML/CSS/Javascript. 
The program utilizes a built in text parser to populate multiple interactive questions that reward the player with an updated webpage 
whenever they correctly identify the error in the code. This also allows for users to create their own questions if they're interested
in expanding the scope of the game. Other features include a click counter to track a player's progress, built in audio files to accompany prompts, 
hints to guide the player, a page to highlight the developers and a final victory page when the player finishes all the available questions.

Optimized for FireFox and Chrome browsers.
